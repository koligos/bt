\chap Introduction

Introduction text. 
Student will get acquainted with fundamental principles of the
algorithms on graphs with a special focus on distributed signal
processing algorithms for radio communication networks. Main focus of
the work should be on average consensus algorithm on the graph.
Student should apply this algorithm on selected simple scenarios in
communication networks, e.g. distributed time or carrier
synchronisation. The algorithms should be implemented in Matlab
including suitable graphical demonstration of the distributed
convergence process and algorithms performance.

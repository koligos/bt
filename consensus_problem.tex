\sec Motivation

Let's think about an experiment, where few nodes aim to provide only one result of measurement based on many local measurments. For example we measure an average temperature in a room. Very acurate measure devices are expensive. We can generally try to replace small number of very good devices by some probably bigger number of less reliable devices whose benefit will be an interchange of information between near nodes.

 They  We want to replace a number of nodes, that exchange informatMany less accurate a reliable nodes as an alternative to very accurate and very reliable but also very expensive nodes.
